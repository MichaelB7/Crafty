Crafty
Crafty is the "son" (direct descendent) of the chess program Cray Blitz.  it is designed totally around the bit-board data structure for reasons of speed of execution, ease of adding new knowledge, and a significantly cleaner overall design.  it is written totally in ANSI C with some few UNIX system calls required for I/O, etc.

 Personal use includes any use you make of the program yourself, either by playing games with it yourself, or allowing others to play it on your machine,  and requires that if others use the program, it must be clearly identified as "Crafty" to anyone playing it (on a chess server as one example).  Personal use does not allow anyone to enter this into a chess tournament where other program authors are invited to participate.
